                <h2>Conner Rental Management</h2>           
                <p> was started in 1966 by long-time Pittsburg resident Dale Conner. Dale had a long career in Pittsburg real estate management and sales, and was an important part of many community organizations and projects. His son Gary, and grand-daughter Leah now proudly operate the business with the same community-oriented mindset.</p><hr>

                <p> Originally located on the second floor of the Professional Building (now Block 22), the office eventually moved downstairs into a storefront space along the 4th Street of the building. After several decades in that location, the renovation of the building for the Block 22 project required the office to relocate one block north to the current location, 108 W 5th Street in Pittsburg.</p><hr>

                <p> Conner Rental Management is proud to continue into the
                    future our long tradition of service and loyalty to
                    Pittsburg tenants and property owners. We hope to have the
                    opportunity to assist you with any real estate needs you may have.</p>
