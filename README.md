CONNER RENTAL MANAGEMENT WEBSITE

14 Jun 2022

Project is an html website with CSS stylings. The business is my current occupation, a property management   
company in a mid-size midwestern town. We manage residential rental properties for property owners across    
the country. I'm hoping to gain a better, working understanding of using the tools I've learned quickly      
and efficiently to produce an attractive website that a business would consider suitable.

Intial versions will be mostly text and images, perhaps some buttons. I'm hoping to make a functional header 
with page buttons, and a boilerpalte page footer with company info. Longer term goals are a page that may 
allow users to contact our office via email to send a message or maintenance request, as well as a page that 
can display vacant properties in an interesting fashion that is easy to access and maintain on the backend.
